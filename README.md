# Earth's Climate Dashboard

# Overview
This project is a dashboard of key indicators of Earth's climate. The key indicators are Temperature, Ocean Temperature, Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Arctic Ice, Mass of Antarctica, Sea Level, Human Population. This dashboard was inspired by NASA's and NOAA's climate dashboards. This project is hosted on Kaggle and you can find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/jarredpriester/earth-s-climate-dashboard

# Purpose of Project
The first purpose of this project is to continue the process of finding the best ways to communicate and visualize the current situation of our climate. The second purpose of this project was to work on different ways to produce a dashboard in python.

# What I Learned
The initial plan was to set up APIs to feed the data into the notebook automaticly. For the scope of this project, those APIs were not available. I learned more about gathering data manually and converting to csv files. I was also able to learn more about the python libary Plotly. I love the fact that you can interact with the plots and customize the data you want to show when hovering over the points in the plots.

# Datasets Used
The datasets were found from NASA, NOAA, The World Bank. Datasets are manually updated on a monthly or yearly basis depending on the data. Data can be found here:
